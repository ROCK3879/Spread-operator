To use this repository:

# In this code:

 - Without the spread operator, assigning an array to another variable creates a reference to the original array, not a copy.
 - Using the spread operator (...) with arrays creates a shallow copy of the original array, which can then be modified independently.
 - Similarly, using the spread operator with objects creates a shallow copy of the original object.
 - The spread operator can also be used to merge arrays or objects.
